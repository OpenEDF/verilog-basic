UVM 1.2
Lab Notes Rev 2018.09
Last Update: 2019-01-02
======================================================================

The labs are setup to run in 32-bit mode by default.

You can enable 64-bit compilation and simulation by setting the CES64
environment variable to TRUE.
e.g. setenv CES64 TRUE

The labs can also run with IEEE UVM.

To enable executing the IEEE UVM source code, you need to set the VCS_UVM_HOME
environment variable to the IEEE UVM source code directory.  The IEEE UVM source
code directory is 1800.2-2017-1.0/src under the ces_uvm-1.2_2018.09 directory.
e.g. setenv VCS_UVM_HOME user_pwd/ces_uvm-1.2_2018.09/1800.2-2017-1.0/src

Remember to unset the VCS_UVM_HOME environment variable afterwards.  Forgetting
to do this will result in running all your UVM testbenches with IEEE UVM.
