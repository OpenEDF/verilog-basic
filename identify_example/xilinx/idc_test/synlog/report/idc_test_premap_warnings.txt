@W: FX1020 |A simulation mismatch is possible. Ignoring vendor library default initial value on registers, because the default value is not set. To enable vendor library default initial values, add the command "set_option -support_implicit_init_netlist 1" to the project file.
@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/macro/github/verilog-basic/identify_example/xilinx/idc_test/instr_sources/syn_dics.v":4342:3:4342:8|Found inferred clock led_stream|clk which controls 295 sequential elements including ident_coreinst.IICE_INST.b5_nUTGT.iclksync_status.b5_uU_cL. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
