Lab Notes Rev 2019.06
Last Update: 2019-06-24
======================================================================

These Instructions are intended to help you with the installation of 
the tools needed to successfully run the labs, and with the installation 
of the lab database itself.

CONTENTS
================================

1. Software installation
2. Lab database installation
3. Lab database configuration and testing

**********************************************************************
1. Software installation
======================================================================

This workshop needs the following tool(s) to be installed:

- VCS  P-2019.06
- VERDI Verdi_P-2019.06

**********************************************************************
2. Lab database Installation
======================================================================

1. Execute the following commands to unpack the archive:

        unix$  gzip -dc ces_svtb_2019.06.tar.gz | tar xf -

   Or if you are using gtar:

        unix$  gtar xzf ces_svtb_2019.06.tar.gz


Multiple account installation:
Since the lab directory structure may contain symbolic links that 
should be preserved instead of being expanded, it is strongly 
recommended that you untar the file directly into each account.
Repeat the following for every user account:

        unix$ cd /path/to/user/account1
        unix$ gzip -dc ces_svtb_2019.06.tar.gz | tar xf -

**********************************************************************
3. Lab database configuration and testing
======================================================================

Testing
==============================

To verify the functionality of the lab files, it is recommended that
you run the supplied test script (the current directory has to be
the "ces_svtb_2019.06" directory):

        unix$  ./.testscript

This will run a series of tests to verify that all files exist, and that
the tool can be invoked.

If everything is ok, you should see output similar to:

 Running  Test 4 - vcs SystemVerilog simulation test
 Skipping Test 5 - GUI (dve)

 Installation Test PASSED for SVTB Course


------------------------------------------------------------

Note:
By default, the GUI (dve) test is skipped.
To include the GUI test, edit the file ".testscript" and change the
variable $test_vcs_gui to "1" at the top of the file. 
Rerun the test after that.
Make sure that you have the DISPLAY environment variable set
correctly, otherwise the test will fail.
